  <div class="relative">
    <h2>Relative</h2>
    <p>
      In order for a secondary element to have an absolute position, the element must be relatively positioned.
    </p>
    <div class="absolute">
      <h2>Absolute</h2>
      <p>
        An absolutely positioned element is positioned in relation to its to its main container.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="sticky">
      <p>I will not move until my container finised.</p>
    </div>

      <p>
    some text inside the relative div object.<br>
     to can do scroll.<br>
    and text how the sticky property works.<br>
    when we do scroll the sticky text doesn't move<br>
    and like the fixed tex has a lower z-index<br>
    it pass down the sticky text but over the absolute one that doesn't have any defined z-index.<br>
      </p>

  </div>

  <div class="static">
    <h2>Other element</h2>
    <p>this has a static posicion, it is by defaul</p>
  </div>

  <div class="fixed">
    <h2>Fixed</h2>
    <p>
      It is positioned relative to the browser window,
      so it always stays in the same place. Like relative position,
      it also uses the top, bottom, left and right properties to specify its location.
    </p>
